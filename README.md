# Anna Godwin

**Senior Research Data Scientist & Senior Data Science Manager**

I'm a data scientist who partners with subject matter experts to build solutions people actually use. My work spans NLP, machine learning, and data pipelines, from analyzing federal public comments to automating criminal justice research workflows. Before data science, I designed medical devices for the developing world.

When I'm not wrangling data, I'm making things: quilts, enameled metalwork, and whatever else catches my attention.
